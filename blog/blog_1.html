        <p>I've always wanted to make my own website, and now here it is. I went with github, mainly because it is free, and I really didn't care all that much for a custom domain. Maybe in the future, perhaps...</p>
        <p>I knew some HTML, but I didn't know a lot about CSS. The first iteration of the website was decent, but zooming in was jank. One thing I did do was made the yellow splash text from minecraft. That was a bit of a pain to do.</p>
        <p>This current iteration is much better, and I've learned some more about HTML/CSS. I even re-did the splash to be even more accurate, since I kinda messed it up a bit - it should be more accurate to the in-game one!</p>
        <p>Website development aside, uh, welcome to the website? I'll probably not use it much, aside from the occasional blog, I may add stuff later. Also, if you are from Dogcraft, Hello!</p>
        <p>Not much else I have to say. Whether you are someone I know from Dogcraft or just a random person who stumbled across this website, I hope you have a wonderful day!</p>
        <p>P.S. Refresh the page, the splash is random! See what you can get!</p>
